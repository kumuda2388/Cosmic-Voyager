# Cosmic-Voyager
The cosmos is the Universe. Using the word cosmos rather than the word universe implies
viewing the universe as a complex and orderly system or entity; the opposite of chaos.
 The cosmos, and our understanding of the reasons of its existence and significance, are
studied in cosmology – a very broad discipline covering any scientific, religious or
philosophical contemplation of the cosmos and its nature, or reasons for existing.
The philosopher Pythagoras first used the term cosmos for the order of the universe. The term
became part of the modern language in the 19th century when geographer-polymath Alexander
von Humboldt resurrected the use of the word from the ancient Greek, assigned to his fivevolume treatise, Kosmos, which influenced the modern and somewhat holistic perception of
the universe as one interacting entity.
Our blog aims to pique our reader’s interest about our universe and make them want to learn
more about the planet we live in, the other planets in our solar system, the galaxy that these
planets are part of, more galaxies that surround us and about other mystifying things still being
researched about in our universe, such as black holes.
