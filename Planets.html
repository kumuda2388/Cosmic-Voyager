            <p><h2>What are planets?</h2></p>
        <p>
          This seemingly simple question doesn't have a simple answer. A planet is a celestial object that orbits a star,
          the sun is the star in our celestial
        </p> 
          <p>neighborhood.</p>
        <p>
     <h3>But can you consider any cesestial object that orbits a star as planet?</h3>
   </p>
   <p>
    The most recent definition of a planet was adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 2006.
     It says a planet must do three things:
     <ol>
      <p> <li>It must orbit a star (in our cosmic neighborhood, the Sun).</li></p>
      <p><li>It must be big enough to have enough gravity to force it into a spherical shape.</li></p>
      <p><li>It must be big enough that its gravity cleared away any other objects of a similar size near its orbit around the Sun.</li></p>
       </ol>
<h2>How are planet formed?</h2>
<p>How did the Solar System's planets come to be? The leading theory is something known as the "protoplanet hypothesis",which essentially says</p>
<p>that very small objects stuck to each other and grew bigger and bigger—big enough to even form planets,but how is that possible?</p>
<p>About 4.6 billion years ago,the location of today's Solar System was nothing more than a loose collection of gas and dust—what we call a </p>
<p> nebula. A nebula is a giant cloud of dust and gas in space. Some nebulae come from the gas and dust thrown  out by the explosion of a dying </p>
<p>star, such as a supernova(super-powerful explosion of a star). A supernova is the biggest explosion that humans have ever seen.Then something </p>
<p>happened that triggered a pressure change in the center of the cloud leading to change in gravity due to which the cloud collapsed and created</p>
<p>a disc of material.The center of this disc saw a great increase in pressure that eventually was so powerful that hydrogen atoms loosely floating</p>
<p>in the cloud began to come into contact. Eventually, they fused and produced helium, kickstarting the formation of the sun. the sun was a </p>
<p>hungry youngster—it ate up 99% of what was swirling around,but this still left 1% of the disc available for other things, and this is where </p>
<p>planet formation began and happened relatively rapidly,small bits of dust and gas began to clump together.The young sun pushed much of the  </p> 
<p>gas out to the outer Solar System, the caused this is still under investigation, but some scientists believe it was because the gas gaints were    </p>   
<p>moving around and perturbing smaller bodies at the fringe of the Solar System. In simple terms, the clumping together of protoplanets(planets </p>             
<p>formation) eventually formed the planets. </p>

  Planets in our solar system:

<p>There are eigth planets in our solar system ,let us learn about them in order of increasing distance of planent from sun </p>

<divI3 class="zoom">
  <img src="Images/mercury3.gif" alt="mercury" align="top" width="400px" height="300px"></img>
    <p>
      <h3>MERCURY</h3> 
      Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System. Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 days, the shortest
      of all the planets in the Solar System.Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar 
      system,Due to Mercury's elliptical egg shaped orbit and sluggish rotation the morning Sun appears to rise briefly, set and 
      rise again from some parts of the planet's surface. The same thing happens in reverse at sunset.
   </p>

    <img src="Images/venus.gif" alt="venus" align="top" width="400px" height="300px"></img>
     <p>
       <h3>VENUS</h3>
       Venus is the second planet from the Sun.Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction most planets do. Its thick 
       atmosphere traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the hottest planet in our solar system with 
       surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead.Its orbit around the Sun takes 255 days and one length of the day 
       is 116d 18h 0m making One day on Venus longer than one year. Venus is the second-brightest natural object in 
       the night sky after the Moon.

 <divI4 class="zoom">
   <img src="Images/earth.gif" alt="earth" align="top" width="400px" height="300px"></img>
     <p><h3>EARTH</h3>Earth is the third planet from the sun. It's the only planet known to have an atmosphere containing free
        oxygen, oceans of water on its surface and the only astronomical object known to harbor life.Its orbit 
        around the Sun takes 365.256 days.Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane,
         producing seasons on Earth .Earth is really an "oblate spheroid," because its spin causes it to be squashed at 
         its poles and swollen at the equator. Moon is Earth's only natural satellite.  </p>

   <divI4 class="zoom">
    <img src="Images/mars.gif" alt="mars" align="top" width="400px" height="300px"></img>
    <p> <h3>MARS</h3>
     Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System after Mercury.In English,
      Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war, and is often referred to as the 'Red Planet'. With a radius of 2,106 
      miles, Mars is the seventh largest planet in our solar system and about half the diameter of Earth. Mars 
      used to have a thicker Atmosphere and water in the ancient past and but now has frozen water.
      Mars has two moons.

  <img src="Images/jupiter.gif" alt="jupiter" align="top" width="400px" height="300px"></img>
   <p> <h3>JUPITER</h3>
     Jupiter is the fifth planet from our Sun and is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system – more than twice as 
     massive as all the other planets combined. Jupiter's stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of
      ammonia and water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium.Jupiter is surrounded by dozens of moons.
       Jupiter also has several rings, but unlike the famous rings of Saturn, Jupiter’s rings are very faint and made of
        dust, not ice.

  <img src="Images/saturn.gif" alt="saturn" align="top" width="400px" height="300px"></img>
  <p> 
    <h3>SATURN</h3>
    Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest planet in our solar system. Adorned with a dazzling
    system of icy rings, Saturn is unique among the planets.  It is not the only planet to have rings, but none are as
   spectacular or as complex as Saturn's.  Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium. The farthest
    planet from Earth discovered by the unaided human eye, Saturn has been known since ancient times. Surrounded by 
    more than 60 known moons.

<divI4 class="zoom">
<img src="Images/uranus.gif" alt="uranus" align="top" width="400px" height="300px"></img>
<p> 
  <h3>URANUS</h3>
    Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass
    in the Solar System. The seventh planet from the Sun with the third largest diameter in our solar system, Uranus is
    very cold and windy. The ice giant is surrounded by 13 faint rings and 27 small moons as it rotates at a nearly 
    90-degree angle from the plane of its orbit.This unique tilt makes Uranus appear to spin on its side, orbiting
    the Sun like a rolling ball.

<divI4 class="zoom">
<img src="Images/neptune.gif" alt="neptune" align="top" width="400px" height="300px"></img>
<p>
   <h3>NEPTUNE</h3>
   Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in the Solar System. In the Solar System, it is the 
   fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. Neptune is 17 times the
   mass of Earth, slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus 
   because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere.
