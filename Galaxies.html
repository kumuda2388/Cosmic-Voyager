            What are galaxies?
        </h2>
        <p class="info-text">
        A galaxy is huge collection of gas,dust, and billions of stars and their solar systems, all held together by gravity.<br> <br>
        The word galaxy is derived from the Greek galaxias (γαλαξίας), literally "milky", a reference to the Milky Way. Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few hundred million (108) stars to giants with one hundred trillion (1014) stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass.

            Are you wondering how many galaxies are there in the universe?
        </h2>
        <p class="info-text">
           A research released in 2016 revised the number of galaxies in the observable universe from a previous estimate of 200 billion (2×1011) to a suggested two trillion (2×1012) or more and, overall, as many as an estimated 1×1024 stars (more stars than all the grains of sand on planet Earth).Most of the galaxies are 1,000 to 100,000 parsecs in diameter (approximately 3000 to 300,000 light years) and separated by distances on the order of millions of parsecs (or megaparsecs).

            Discovering island universes
        </h2>
        <p class="info-text">
            In the early 1900s, many astronomers thought that the entire universe lay within our galaxy, the Milky Way. Others, such as Harlow Shapley, a scientist and head of the Harvard College Observatory, argued that the spiral-shaped blobs thought to be dust and gas were separate and called them "island universes."
            
            It wasn't until 1924, when Edwin Hubble identified several special pulsing stars called Cepheid variables and realized that they lay outside of the known span of the Milky Way. These celestial objects were completely unique collections of stars at distances well beyond our home galaxy.
            
            After Hubble measured the distance to individual galaxies, he went on to measure their Doppler shift — how much light from the galaxies was stretched out due to their motion. He determined that galaxies all around the Milky Way are moving away from us at terrific speeds. The farther away the galaxies are, the faster they are fleeing. Because of this, he was able to determine that the universe itself is expanding, and years later, astronomers determined that the expansion is accelerating.

                What happens when galaxies collide?</h2>
                  
            <p class="info-text">
             
            Galaxies don't float through space in isolation but are bunched together in groups known as clusters. Some clusters are large, containing over a thousand galaxies while others are much smaller. The Milky Way lies within the cluster known as the Local Group, which only contains 50 galaxies.
            Occasionally, galaxies slam into one another, merging their stars and dust together. This is an important step in the evolution and growth of many galaxies. In late 2018, astronomers released a study showing two supermassive black holes crashing into one another in the final stages of a galactic smashup, representing the first time such a late stage of galaxy collision was seen in action.
            Individual stars generally don't collide in a galactic collision, but the influx of dust and gas bumps up the rate of star formation.  Milky Way is set to collide with the Andromeda galaxy in about 5 billion years, and collisions have occurred in its ancient past as well; its distinctive bulge may have developed after consuming a sausage-shaped galaxy. Not to be outdone, the Andromeda galaxy probably ate up one of the Milky Way's early siblings, too.

            Characteristics of a GALAXY
        </h2>
        <p class="info-text">
             Most galaxies have black holes at their centers that can produce a tremendous amount of energy, which astronomers can see over great distances. In some cases, a galaxy’s central black hole is extremely large or active, even in relatively small galaxies. Material circling the black hole may be accelerated outward by its jets. Other galaxies may contain quasars — the most energetic bodies in the universe — at their core.

            Types of galaxies
        </h2>
        <p class="info-text">
            Galaxies come in three main types: ellipticals, spirals, and irregulars. A slightly more extensive description of galaxy types based on their appearance is given by the Hubble sequence. Since the Hubble sequence is entirely based upon visual morphological type (shape), it may miss certain important characteristics of galaxies such as star formation rate in starburst galaxies and activity in the cores of active galaxies

                    <pre>Spiral Galaxy</pre>
                    These resemble spiraling pinwheels. Though the stars and other visible material contained in such a galaxy lie mostly on a plane, the majority of mass in spiral galaxies exists in a roughly spherical halo of dark matter which extends beyond the visible component, as demonstrated by the universal rotation curve concept.These consist of a rotating disk of stars and interstellar medium, along with a central bulge of generally older stars. Extending outward from the bulge are relatively bright arms. The spiral arms do have the shape of approximate logarithmic spirals, a pattern that can be theoretically shown to result from a disturbance in a uniformly rotating mass of stars. Like the stars, the spiral arms rotate around the center, but they do so with constant angular velocity. The spiral arms are thought to be areas of high-density matter, or "density waves".

                    <pre>Elliptical Galaxy</pre>
                     These galaxies have an ellipsoidal profile, giving them an elliptical appearance regardless of the viewing angle. Their appearance shows little structure and they typically have relatively little interstellar matter. Consequently, these galaxies also have a low portion of open clusters and a reduced rate of new star formation. Instead they are dominated by generally older, more evolved stars that are orbiting the common center of gravity in random directions. The stars contain low abundances of heavy elements because star formation ceases after the initial burst. In this sense they have some similarity to the much smaller globular clusters.

                    <pre>Shell galaxy </pre>
                    A shell galaxy is a type of elliptical galaxy where the stars in the galaxy's halo are arranged in concentric shells. About one-tenth of elliptical galaxies have a shell-like structure, which has never been observed in spiral galaxies. The shell-like structures are thought to develop when a larger galaxy absorbs a smaller companion galaxy. As the two galaxy centers approach, the centers start to oscillate around a center point, the oscillation creates gravitational ripples forming the shells of stars, similar to ripples spreading on water. For example, galaxy NGC 3923 has over twenty shells.

                    <pre>Ring Galaxy</pre>
                    A galaxy with a circle-like appearance. Hoag's Object, discovered by Art Hoag in 1950, is an example of a ring galaxy.The ring contains many massive, relatively young blue stars, which are extremely bright. The central region contains relatively little luminous matter. Some astronomers believe that ring galaxies are formed when a smaller galaxy passes through the center of a larger galaxy. Because most of a galaxy consists of empty space, this "collision" rarely results in any actual collisions between stars. However, the gravitational disruptions caused by such an event could cause a wave of star formation to move through the larger galaxy. Other astronomers think that rings are formed around some galaxies when external accretion takes place. Star formation would then take place in the accreted material because of the shocks and compressions of the accreted material.

                    <pre> Barred spiral galaxy</pre>
                   
                    A majority of spiral galaxies, including our own Milky Way galaxy, have a linear, bar-shaped band of stars that extends outward to either side of the core, then merges into the spiral arm structure. In the Hubble classification scheme, these are designated by an SB, followed by a lower-case letter (a, b or c) which indicates the form of the spiral arms (in the same manner as the categorization of normal spiral galaxies). Bars are thought to be temporary structures that can occur as a result of a density wave radiating outward from the core, or else due to a tidal interaction with another galaxy. Many barred spiral galaxies are active, possibly as a result of gas being channeled into the core along the arms.
                    
                    Our own galaxy, the Milky Way, is a large disk-shaped barred-spiral galaxy about 30 kiloparsecs in diameter and a kiloparsec thick. It contains about two hundred billion (2×1011) stars and has a total mass of about six hundred billion (6×1011) times the mass of the Sun.

                    A galaxy intermediate between an elliptical (denoted E) and a spiral galaxy in galaxy morphological classification schemes.It contains a large-scale disc but does not have large-scale spiral arms. Lenticular galaxies are disc galaxies that have used up or lost most of their interstellar matter and therefore have very little ongoing star formation.They may, however, retain significant dust in their disks. As a result, they consist mainly of aging stars (like elliptical galaxies). Despite the morphological differences, lenticular and elliptical galaxies share common properties like spectral features and scaling relations. Both can be considered early-type galaxies that are passively evolving, at least in the local part of the Universe. Connecting the E galaxies with the S0 galaxies are the ES galaxies with intermediate-scale discs.

           Galaxy VS Nebula
        </h2>

        <pre class="txtdiv" >
            Nebula is a cloud of interstellar dust, while galaxy is a huge collection of stars. 
            Size of a galaxy is much larger than size of a nebula.
            Nebula cause star formation.
            Nebula is present within a galaxy. Galaxy cannot be present within a nebula.
            Nebulae are classified into emission, HII region, supernova remnant and dark.
            Galaxies are classified into spiral, elliptical and irregular.
            Galaxies live longer than nebulae.
            Life of several stars is connected to life of a galaxy while life of only one star is associated with a nebula.
            Galaxies can be found in clusters in space.
